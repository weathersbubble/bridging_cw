    <p class="about-paragraph ">I'm a first year Computer Science student (with industrial year) from the University of Birmingham, to graduate in 2023. On campus, I'm also both a student blogger, and a Student Ambassador, for the School of Computer Science. Off campus, I teach
        skateboarding at Creation Skatepark in Moseley.<br><br> I've created this website to complete the *unexpected* end of year coursework<br><br> Unfortunately my data science internship for Summer 2020 has been very much reduced in length and changed
        to a remote placement, so I'm currently spending lockdown learning new skills & improving my employability. Hopefully my Industrial Placement can go ahead, and I'm looking for a finance based role (quantitative analysis?), so I've got a few online
        data science & programming courses habitating in my to-do lists.
